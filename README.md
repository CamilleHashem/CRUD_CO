# CRUD_CO
Basic Crud 

No much to this.

Its a small CRUD app.

Not much error checking going on.

You can take a picture through your webcam and it uploads it to Cloudinary so you can get to it anywhere you want.

The database is on Heroku

I have not included the connection to the DB forobvious reasons


TO DO:

Fix the upload image to get into the database
